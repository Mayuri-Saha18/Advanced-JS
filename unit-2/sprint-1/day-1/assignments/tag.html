    <h1>b tag</h1>
<p>The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the <strong> element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>
   <h4>Examples</h4> 
<p>
  This article describes several <b class="keywords">text-level</b> elements.
  It explains their usage in an <b class="keywords">HTML</b> document.
</p>
Keywords are displayed with the default style of the <b>element, likely in bold.</b>
<h1> i tag</h1>
<p>The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.</p>
<p>In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the <i> element was merely a presentational element used to display text in italics, much like the <i> element was used to display text in bold letters. This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display the contents of the </i> element in italic type, but is, by definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic type, authors should use the CSS font-style property.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>The Latin phrase <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i> is often mentioned in music, art, and literature.</p>
<h1>u tag</h1>
<p>The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
The <u> tag in HTML stands for underline, and itâ€™s used to underline the text enclosed within the </u> tag. This tag is generally used to underline misspelled words. This tag requires a starting as well as ending tag.
 <h1>select tag</h1>   
 <p>The <select> HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.The <select> tag in HTML is used to create a drop-down list. The <select> tag contains <option> tag to display the available option of drop-down list.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<label for="pet-select">Choose a pet:</label>
<select name="pets" id="pet-select">
    <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
    <option value="dog">Dog</option>
    <option value="cat">Cat</option>
    <option value="hamster">Hamster</option>
    <option value="parrot">Parrot</option>
    <option value="spider">Spider</option>
    <option value="goldfish">Goldfish</option>
</select>
<p>The above example shows typical <select> usage. It is given an id attribute to enable it to be associated with a <label> for accessibility purposes, as well as a name attribute to represent the name of the associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by an <option> element nested inside the <select>.

    Each <option> element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a selected attribute on an <option> element to make it selected by default when the page first loads.
    
    The <select> element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc.</p>
<h1>button tag</h1>
<p>The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.</p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <p><button name="button">Press me</button></p>
</body>
